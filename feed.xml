This challenge demonstrates the difficulty of creating randomness in a deterministic system such as the blockchain. Since all the validator nodes need to come to the same exact answer, it is impossible to have a truly random result for each time the code is executed. Assessment Knowing our o... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Ethernaut 02 Fallout</title><link href="https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-02-fallout/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ethernaut 02 Fallout" /><published>2022-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-02-fallout/</id> <content src="https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-02-fallout/" /> <author> <name>man715</name> </author> <category term="Smart Contract" /> <category term="Write-up" /> <summary> Introduction The objective for this challenge is it take ownership of the contract. To be honest, this challenge is pretty pointless in and of itself; however, I think we can still learn something from it. Let’s take a look. According to the solidity documentation, Prior to version 0.4.22, constructors were defined as functions with the same name as the contract. This syntax was deprecated... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Ethernaut 01 Fallback</title><link href="https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-01-fallback/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ethernaut 01 Fallback" /><published>2022-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-08-05T12:00:49+00:00</updated> <id>https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-01-fallback/</id> <content src="https://man715.github.io/posts/ethernaut-01-fallback/" /> <author> <name>man715</name> </author> <category term="Smart Contract" /> <category term="Write-up" /> <summary> Introduction The introduction gives us four hints so first let’s check those out. How to send ether when interacting with an ABI How to send ether outside of the ABI Converting to and from wei/ether units Fallback methods Fallback Function The fallback function is designed to be called under specific circumstances. The function called is not found. The contract was sent Ether ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My OSCP Journey</title><link href="https://man715.github.io/posts/my-oscp-journey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My OSCP Journey" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-07-07T02:09:57+00:00</updated> <id>https://man715.github.io/posts/my-oscp-journey/</id> <content src="https://man715.github.io/posts/my-oscp-journey/" /> <author> <name>Man715</name> </author> <category term="OSCP" /> <category term="Hacking" /> <summary> My OSCP Journey There are a lot of blog posts out there where people talk about their journey to getting the OSCP and I’d like to add my two cents. This is not going to be a how to pass the OSCP. This blog post may not even give you anything you can use to help you pass the OSCP. It is simply me discussing what I did and how I felt about the OSCP. Why did I take the OSCP? First of all, I would... </summary> </entry> </feed>
